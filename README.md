# Web-API-Code-Quiz
In this challenge, we were tasked with creating a web API timed quiz to test our coding knowledge.  JavaScript was used to add a timer element that decremented by one-second starting at 75 seconds.  For each wrong answer, the timer would be further decremented by 10 seconds resulting in the time remaining as the player's final score.  Various other JavaScript methods were used to display certain sections of the html file upon click (event listeners) as well as appending new text elements on the screen. The questions and answers used for this challenge were from the original mock-up in the assignment ReadMe. Please see my fully commented index.html, style.css, and script.js files which further delineate the methods used.
